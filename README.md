Thoughts - based on slatejs

Create everything
Thoughts can help you create everything you need for your work, such as meeting minutes, event planning, project planning, product requirements documentation, and more. You can quickly use the templates of these documents to create content in an elegant and fluid experience.


Full of life documents
In addition to inserting images, files, and links into your documents, you can also associate commonly used third-party content, display it directly in the document, and keep it up to date. You don't have to manually update it, the entire document seems to be alive.

Organize your knowledge content
The knowledge base uses a tree-like directory structure to help you better organize your knowledge; each level of the tree directory can be a document, folder, or file that holds all the knowledge in the team.

Content-based communication
Each document can communicate with the corresponding comments, so your team will always have context. Communication, decision making, and feedback are all in the same place as they should be, rather than being drowned in an email or chat window.

Work anytime, anywhere
We offer a full-platform solution for accessing, authoring and editing documents from anywhere, on your mobile phone or on your computer.

instapage idea 

https://www.quora.com/What-technology-does-instapage-use-for-template-editing

In terms of softwares used, we do most of the work inside the Instapage builder and then finish things off using Photoshop or Sketch.

I think the most interesting part is actually the development process of each landing page template.

Each new project starts by choosing which type of landing page template our collection needs and picking an industry, find common similarities for that specific industry by analyzing different landing pages created by our users, then create wireframe layouts based on conversion centered design principles directly inside the builder.

Once we have the layout in place, our visual designers will start styling the landing page.

Each template goes through a couple rounds of revisions until we make sure it follows our internal standards and guidelines.

All of the templates are created with a specific goal in mind, to help marketers build effective landing pages faster and improve the overall quality of the landing pages created using our builder in the long run.

How does YouTube calculate its views?


In my research it is based on I.P. address and if the user is logged in, if the view is a unique (new) i.p address that counts as a view and if the user is logged in how ever many times they view the video that counts as one view.

Reminder - flow to improve

1) In comment page the informatiion about blog title and username will not be visible if page is refreshed i.e no information available about the author and blog on comment state . it is only visible when you click show comments page if visited from the application flow because blog data is stored in blog state from redux . however blog id can be easily retrieved from the match.params for url which is used to make request to retrieve collection of comments of that blog id . 

2) add this in carousel for next product line 
	{   style:"carousel_type1",
        bg_image:"https://res.cloudinary.com/surajsharma/image/upload/v1568712315/muchstoryimages/yellowbggraphic.jpg",
        text:["customize homepage,logo and","categories at $499 only"]
